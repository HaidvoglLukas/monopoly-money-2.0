## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Clone the repo and cd into the project.
2. Install dependencies by executing `npm install`.
3. Setup environment variables. This can be done two ways:
   - Set the environment variables in the current terminal session
   - Copy the .env.example files in the server and client packages and populate them:
     - Examples are at: `packages/server/.env.example` and `packages/client/.env.example`
     - Copy these using `cp .env.example .env` and populate them both.
4. Build dependencies using `npm run build`.
5. Execute `npm start` to start the server

The environment variables that can be used are (can also be found in .env.example files):

- `REACT_APP_API_ROOT` (optional): The route that the client requests. Not setting this will default to `window.location.origin`.
- `SERVER_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (optional): The origins that are served by the server. Not setting this is the equivalent of setting CORS to \*.

### üß™ Development Setup

When running the client in development mode using `npm run client:dev`, the client will use the `REACT_APP_API_ROOT` environment variable value to decide where to send requests. If this is not provided, the current hosted URL will be used.

`npm run server:dev` can also be used for development of the server; this allows for hot-reloading. Running the client using `npm run client:dev` and setting `REACT_APP_API_ROOT` to where the server is running will allow for a development setup with hot-reloading.

> `launch.json` also offers the ability to connect and debug the the server when running `npm run client:dev`.

## üìù Features

- Multiple games can be hosted on the server at once
- Each player uses their own device; everyone joins one game.
- Send money between players quickly
- The person that created the game is the banker. This person can:
  - Give money to players from the bank (and take money)
  - Give free parking to players
  - Update player names
  - Delete players
  - Stop new people from joining the game
  - End the game completely
- History is recorded of each game event that can be viewed by all players

## ‚ùì Why?

If you have every played the credit card edition of Monopoly, you will appreciate how much faster the game moves without having to count cash. This webapp substitutes the need for cash in a game of monopoly for a mobile-banking-like solution where players can easily send each other virtual currency.

## üåê Deployment

This application was designed to have the server deployed on Heroku (with the client) and a separate client on GitHub Pages.

- When deploying with Heroku, make sure to set `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` to `false` in config vars otherwise packages will not be installed correctly.
- The client deployment workflow can be found in [main.yml](./.github/workflows/main.yml).

## üöß TODO

The base of this application is completed, there are just a few more cosmetic goals I'm aiming for:

- Show most recent transactions on from/to tiles
  - Coloured values in brackets - e.g. (-\$500,000)
  - Timeout? Use a hook? The hook can look at the most recent transaction time and set a timeout when to remove them or not to display at all?
  - Or show a heading at the top e.g. Brent => Bank (\$2,000,000) in green for 5 seconds
    - Hold place to not move stuff up and down
- Passing go button in banker [settings, player dropdown, send]
  - Settings is a local storage value of the amount to send
  - The past go amount is shown above: "Past Go (\$2,000,000)"
- Remove send money buttons?
- Requests
  - Game event
  - Bank and players can get them
  - Shows at the top of funds / top of bank page
  - Can approve or decline
  - Approval triggers a payment
  - This request is then removed in the game state when approved, declined.
  - Hold down on players tile?
- Help button
  - Small tutorial with GIFs
  - Layout: Title, description, GIF (repeat)
- Put the current version at the bottom of help
- Screenshots on Nitratine and then link in the README
- useStoredGames spams the server when you have many stored games that aren't on the server anymore
