## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Setup the server
   - Execute `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Execute `cp .env.example .env` (or `copy` for Windows) and populate `.env` by replacing XXXXXX's
3. Setup the client
   - `cd client` to change directories to the client project
   - Execute `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Execute `cp .env.example .env` (or `copy` for Windows)
   - Execute `npm run build` to build the client (the server will host these built files)
   - Go back to the project root: `cd ..`
4. Execute `npm start` to start the server

### üß™ Development Setup

When running the client in development mode using `npm start`, the client will use the `REACT_APP_API_ROOT` environment variable value to decide where to send requests. If this is not provided, the current hosted URL will be used.

`npm run dev` can also be used for development of the server; this allows for hot-reloading. Running the client using `npm start` and setting `REACT_APP_API_ROOT` to where the server is running will allow for a development setup with hot-reloading.

> `launch.json` also offers the ability to connect and debug the the server when running `npm run dev`.
