1. Nothing here yet

## Development
Pretty much everything, but here is a checklist of what I want to add; will be removing them once they get old
 - [ ] Banker/Player selection
 - [ ] Host multiple games from server: banker creates new gave and gives token to new players (means this could be hosted somewhere)
 - [ ] Banker can switch to being a player with a button
 - [ ] History of transfers to banker
 - [ ] Private history of transfers between users
 - [ ] Can select whether to show balances to others
 - [ ] User to bank and bank to user history is public
 - [ ] Quick transaction buttons for banker
 - [ ] Game preset selections (start amount, what go gives you, get out of jail amount)(customise own)
